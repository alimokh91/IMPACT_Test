	version 130506

  - user function read_evecs changed to read 2D biglobal eigenfunctions, 2D interpolation. To this end:

  - moved function solve_eigenproblem from mod_test.f90 to external file
  - deactivated task 3 of impact.f90

      (Taks 3 was never properly written: it's a series of mod functions which nevertheless depend on user files.
      Already Rolf commented some of the calls (i.e. the one to obtain the basic flow profiles), which lead to user files...)
      FOR THE FUTURE: One may reactivate the functions, but: if written as mod functions, make sure that content does not
      depend on user functions, especially that initconds in user files are 2D now (biglobal!)

    CHANGES STEP BY STEP:
      - delete eveci from usr_config for all i > 3
      - move eveci from mod_vars to usr_vars for all i <= 3
      - move evec_refi from mod_vars to usr_vars for all i <=3
      - delete eveci and evec_refi for all i <= 3 from allocate.f90
      - move n_evec from mod_vars to usr_vars
      - delete catch for n_evec = 0 in solve_eigenproblem
      - move subroutines "solve_eigenproblem", "eigen_temp" and "eigen_spat" from mod_test.f90 to usr_eigen.f90
      - remove task 3 from impact.f90

  version 141216

  - all non-Boussinesq preprocessor pragmas have been commented out,
    after verification they will be deleted, since for the IB method for
    AV we only solve for incompressible fluid.

  version 141219

  - all non-Boussinesq preprocessor pragmas and the encompassed parts of code have been deleted. The conservation of 
    code logic and execution has been verified. Density fluctuations in the hemodynamic flow of the IB simulations are not of
    interest at the current state. If desired, the corresponding parts can be reintegrated.
    
  version 150105
  
  - all parts associated with particles, concentrations and LES have been commented out. The program was verified with respect to a
    reference run to have unaltered output (compiler optimizations disabled). 
    
  version 150106
  
  - all parts that were commented out before are now removed completely. The results have been verified to the same reference run.
  
  version 150528

  - new module file mod_ibm.f90 was added. All the routines associated with the boundary are stored inside the corresponding module.
    calls to the specific routines are done within the previously existing IMPACT framework. Immersed Boundaries can be disabled/enabled
    by setting the logical variable IB_ON to either false or true, respectively.
